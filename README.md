# Developer Portfolio Website

This project is a personal developer portfolio website, created as both a learning exercise and a professional platform to showcase my skills, projects, and growth as a web developer. The primary purpose of this website is to provide an online presence where potential employers, collaborators, and peers can explore my technical abilities and achievements in a visually appealing and user-friendly format.

Through building this website, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of modern web development technologies and best practices. Every aspect of the site, from its design and responsiveness to its functionality and deployment, reflects the knowledge and experience I've gained in coding, problem-solving, and project management.
